# Ideas for hacking

- modify AINET to use different method for weights (not truncating negative gini index decrease to zero, but shifting)
- change/tune gamma (exponent) of weights
- add sparsity condition in data generating process
- remove elastic net
- remove EPV=20, so logistic regression doesn't look as good
- look at estimation performance instead of prediction
