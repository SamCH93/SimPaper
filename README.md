# SimPaper

We want to write a paper for the following [call](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15214036/homepage/call_for_papers.html#neutralcomparisonstudies)

## Todo

- [x] Invent method
- [x] Give cool name to method
- [x] Implement method
- [x] Literature review (SP, LK, KR)
- [x] Literature review simulation studies, realistic parameter settings (SP, LK, KR)
- [x] Literature review performance metrics, normalize Brier score (SP, LK, KR)
- [x] Write up theory (LK)
- [x] Implement simDesign functions and fix TODOs in code (LK, SP)
- [x] Plan number of simulations for desired MC error (SP, LK)
- [x] Simulation protocol (SP, LK, KR)
- [ ] Extend list of QRPs (SP, LK, KR)
- [ ] Set up hacked experiments (SP, LK, KR)
- [ ] Write paper (SP, LK, KR)

## Ideas for hacking

- In higher-dim settings, we beat everything but EN in terms of Brier (exclude?)
- AUC looks consistently bad (remove?)
