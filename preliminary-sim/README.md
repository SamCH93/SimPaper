# Preliminary Simulation

This folder contains scripts to reproduce the results of the preliminary
simulations. These were used for, e.g., tuning the simulation size.

The code for re-running the preliminary simulation can be found in
`preliminary-simulation.R`.

The `anova.R` script analyzes the resulting estimates and `prelimAnalysis.R`
reproduces the analysis of errors and warnings.
